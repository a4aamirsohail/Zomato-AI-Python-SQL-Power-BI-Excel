## Project Structure

- **Early Preprocessing (ChatGPT):** Data quality assessment
- **Excel Preprocessing:** Duplicate removal & cleaning
- **SQL Data Cleaning:** Null handling & standardization
- **Power BI Visualization & DAX Measures:** Avg Order Value, Avg Rating, Avg Sale, Last Order Date, Total Orders, Total Sales
- **Business Problem-Solving (SQL):** Addressed key business queries

## SQL Code Samples

```sql
-- Standardize Date Format (DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM)
UPDATE Zomato
SET order_datetime = TRY_CONVERT(DATETIME, order_datetime, 105);

-- Recalculate missing total_amount
UPDATE Zomato
SET total_amount = (quantity * item_price) - discount_amount
WHERE total_amount IS NULL;

-- Standardize city names (trim + proper case)
UPDATE Zomato
SET city = LTRIM(RTRIM(LOWER(city)));

-- Clean phone numbers (remove spaces, symbols)
UPDATE Zomato
SET customer_phone = REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(customer_phone, ' ', ''), '-', ''), '(+91)', '91');

-- Handle missing payment_method
UPDATE Zomato
SET payment_method = 'Unknown'
WHERE payment_method IS NULL;

-- Update all customer_name names in a table
UPDATE Zomato
SET customer_name = UPPER(LEFT(customer_name, 1)) + LOWER(SUBSTRING(customer_name, 2, LEN(customer_name)));

-- Update all area names in a table
UPDATE Zomato
SET area = UPPER(LEFT(area, 1)) + LOWER(SUBSTRING(area, 2, LEN(area)));

-- Update all restaurant names in a table
UPDATE Zomato
SET restaurant_name = UPPER(LEFT(restaurant_name, 1)) + LOWER(SUBSTRING(restaurant_name, 2, LEN(restaurant_name)));

-- KPI Queries

-- Total Revenue
SELECT SUM(total_amount) AS Total_Revenue FROM Zomato;

-- Top 5 Restaurants by Revenue
SELECT TOP 5 restaurant_name, SUM(total_amount) AS Revenue
FROM Zomato
GROUP BY restaurant_name
ORDER BY Revenue DESC;

-- Average Customer Rating
SELECT AVG(rating) AS Avg_Rating FROM Zomato WHERE rating IS NOT NULL;

-- Customer Segmentation by Total Amount
SELECT
    total_amount,
    CASE
        WHEN total_amount > 1200 THEN 'Gold'
        WHEN total_amount > 600 AND total_amount <= 1200 THEN 'Silver'
        WHEN total_amount > 0 AND total_amount <= 600 THEN 'Bronze'
        ELSE 'UNKNOWN'
    END AS Customer_Segment
FROM Zomato;
```

## Python Code Samples

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Desktop\Zomato.csv")
df.head()

# Check for missing values
df.isnull().sum()
df.info()

# Convert 'order_datetime' to datetime format
df['order_datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(df['order_datetime'], format='mixed', dayfirst=True)

# Extract month, year, and day from 'order_datetime'
df['Order_Month'] = df['order_datetime'].dt.month
df['Order_Year'] = df['order_datetime'].dt.year
df['Order_Day'] = df['order_datetime'].dt.day

# Handle missing values
df = df.dropna(subset=['customer_email', 'customer_phone'])
df['payment_method'].fillna('Unknown', inplace=True)

# Check for duplicates
df.duplicated().sum()
df[df.duplicated(keep=False)].sort_values(by=['order_id'])

# Plot the number of orders per month
sns.lineplot(x='Order_Month', y='total_amount', data=df)
plt.title('Order Amount by Month')
plt.show()

sns.countplot(x='Order_Month', data=df)
plt.title('Number of Orders per Month')
plt.show()
```
